# EEG-Based Insomnia Detection Using CNN

This project uses deep learning (CNN) to classify EEG signals as normal or insomnia. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Structure
- `data/`: EEG CSV files
- `preprocessing/`: Data loading and scaling
- `models/`: CNN architecture
- `training/`: Training logic
- `evaluation/`: Model testing
- `utils/`: Config and plotting
- `main.py`: Runs everything

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
