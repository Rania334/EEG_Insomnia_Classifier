# EEG-Based Insomnia Detection Using CNN

This project applies deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify EEG signals for detecting insomnia versus normal sleep patterns. It leverages EEG data preprocessing, advanced model design, training with validation, and comprehensive evaluation with visualizations to ensure model robustness and interpretability.

## Features

- **EEG Data Preprocessing:** Load raw EEG datasets for normal and insomnia subjects, standardize features, and prepare data for model input.
- **CNN Model Architecture:** Custom 1D CNN architecture optimized for time-series EEG classification.
- **Training & Validation:** Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets with real-time monitoring of loss and accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Quantitative performance metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and prediction visualization.
- **Visualization:** Training curves and sample predictions plotted and saved as images.
- **Modular Codebase:** Clean separation into preprocessing, modeling, training, evaluation, and utility modules for scalability and maintainability.
